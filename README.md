# BuzzFeedRecipeBook
This is a project to collect recipes from Buzzfeed. Many of their articles are title "M easy N-ingredient recipes". I thought, why not collect them all into a single dataset?

Example:

## Gingerbread Cake + Cool Whip + Orange Marmalade = Orange Gingerbread Trifles

_Usually a url to the exact recipe is included here, if not the recipe itself_
